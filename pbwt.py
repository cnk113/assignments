"""The following uses Python to challenge you to create an algorithm for finding
matches between a set of aligned strings. Minimal familiarity with Python is 
necessary, notably list and Numpy array slicing. 
"""

"""Problem 1.

Let X be a list of M binary strings (over the alphabet { 0, 1 }) each of length 
N. 

For integer 0<=i<=N we define an ith prefix sort as a lexicographic sort 
(here 0 precedes 1) of the set of ith prefixes: { x[:i] | x in X }.
Similarly an ith reverse prefix sort is a lexicographic sort of the set of
ith prefixes after each prefix is reversed.

Let A be an Mx(N+1) matrix such that for all 0<=i<M, 0<=j<=N, A[i,j] is the 
index in X of the ith string ordered by jth reverse prefix. To break ties 
(equal prefixes) the ordering of the strings in X is used. 

Complete code for the following function that computes A for a given X.

Here X is a Python list of Python strings. 
To represent A we use a 2D Numpy integer array.

Example:

>>> X = getRandomX() #This is in the challenge1UnitTest.py file
>>> X
['110', '000', '001', '010', '100', '001', '100'] #Binary strings, M=7 and N=3
>>> A = constructReversePrefixSortMatrix(X)

       [4, 0, 6, 0],
       [5, 4, 3, 2],
       [6, 6, 0, 5]])

Hint:
Column j (0 < j <= N) of the matrix can be constructed from column j-1 and the 
symbol in each sequence at index j-1.  

Question 1: In terms of M and N what is the asymptotic cost of your algorithm?
O(NM)

Problem 4.

Define the common suffix of two strings to be the maximum length suffix shared 
by both strings, e.g. for "10110" and "10010" the common suffix is "10" because 
both end with "10" but not both "110" or both "010". 

Let D be a Mx(N+1) Numpy integer array such that for all 1<=i<M, 1<=j<=N, 
D[i,j] is the length of the common suffix between the substrings X[A[i,j]][:j] 
and X[A[i-1,j]][:j].  

Complete code for the following function that computes D for a given A.

Example:

>>> X = getRandomX()
>>> X
['110', '000', '001', '010', '100', '001', '100']
>>> A = constructReversePrefixSortMatrix(X)
>>> A
array([[0, 1, 1, 1],
       [1, 2, 2, 4],
       [2, 3, 5, 6],
       [3, 5, 4, 3],
       [4, 0, 6, 0],
       [5, 4, 3, 2],
       [6, 6, 0, 5]])
>>> D = constructCommonSuffixMatrix(A, X)
>>> D
array([[0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 2, 2],
       [0, 1, 2, 3],
       [0, 1, 1, 1],
       [0, 0, 2, 2],
       [0, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 1, 3]])

Hints:

As before, column j (0 < j <= N) of the matrix can be constructed from column j-1
and thesymbol in each sequence at index j-1.

For an efficient algorithm consider that the length of the common suffix
between X[A[i,j]][:j] and X[A[i-k,j]][:j], for all 0<k<=i is
min(D[i-k+1,j], D[i-k+2,j], ..., D[i,j]).

Question 4: In terms of M and N what is the asymptotic cost of your algorithm?
It should be O(MN) if I got it to work.

of X[x] and X[y] that ends at j (so that X[x][j] != X[y][j] or j == N) that is longer
