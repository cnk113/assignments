"""The following uses Python to challenge you to create an algorithm for finding
matches between a set of aligned strings. Minimal familiarity with Python is 
necessary, notably list and Numpy array slicing. 
"""

"""Problem 1.

Let X be a list of M binary strings (over the alphabet { 0, 1 }) each of length 
N. 

For integer 0<=i<=N we define an ith prefix sort as a lexicographic sort 
(here 0 precedes 1) of the set of ith prefixes: { x[:i] | x in X }.
Similarly an ith reverse prefix sort is a lexicographic sort of the set of
ith prefixes after each prefix is reversed.

Let A be an Mx(N+1) matrix such that for all 0<=i<M, 0<=j<=N, A[i,j] is the 
index in X of the ith string ordered by jth reverse prefix. To break ties 
(equal prefixes) the ordering of the strings in X is used. 

Complete code for the following function that computes A for a given X.

Here X is a Python list of Python strings. 
To represent A we use a 2D Numpy integer array.

Example:

>>> X = getRandomX() #This is in the challenge1UnitTest.py file
>>> X
['110', '000', '001', '010', '100', '001', '100'] #Binary strings, M=7 and N=3
>>> A = constructReversePrefixSortMatrix(X)
>>> A
array([[0, 1, 1, 1],
       [1, 2, 2, 4],
       [2, 3, 5, 6],
       [3, 5, 4, 3],
       [4, 0, 6, 0],
       [5, 4, 3, 2],
       [6, 6, 0, 5]])
>>> 

Hint:
Column j (0 < j <= N) of the matrix can be constructed from column j-1 and the 
symbol in each sequence at index j-1.

Question 3b: What could you use the transformation of Y for? 
Hint: consider the BWT.
Since each column of Y is the BWT, they can recreate the original strings, in this case X. It is more compact

We can just store the last column of Y and recreate the X.
